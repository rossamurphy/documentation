## We charge per page

We count the number of pages in each document you post to our API, and we bill you based on that number. We will charge you a set amount of credits per page we process. 

We calculate the number of credits you need, to successfully fulfil your request, before we start processing. If you don't have enough credits, we'll let you know, and, we'll tell you how many more credits you need to proceed.

It's really easy to check how many credits you have, and to add more, [here](https://readfile.io/dashboard).

## Better models cost more 

You can choose the "strategy" you want to process your file, by using [query parameters](https://apidog.com/articles/http-request-parameters-guide/).

The available strategies are:

### Default

- Choose this strategy by adding the query parameter "default", i.e. `?strategy=default` at the end of the URL (or, by simply leaving it blank).
- The _fastest and cheapest_ strategy.
- Extracts _text_ from files, and makes no attempt to extract anything more. 
  - This means it's great for long contracts full of words, for example, but not a great option for documents which are full of tables (and where you need the information contained in the tables). 
- Outputs text (i.e. you should expect to receive a string back from the endpoint).
- Supports PDF and Word documents.

### Vision

- Choose this strategy by adding the query parameter "vision", i.e. `?strategy=vision` at the end of the URL.
- Can read everything from files, i.e. tables, images, watermarks, text, etc. 
- Outputs text (i.e. you should expect to receive a string back from the endpoint).
- This is a great option for documents which contain tables, and documents where the structure of the information on the page is important for human-level understanding (for example: invoices, receipts, and bills-of-lading).
- Supports PDF, Word documents, and JPEG images.

### SOTA

- Choose this strategy by adding the query parameter "sota", i.e. `?strategy=sota` at the end of the URL.
- Can read everything from files, i.e. tables, images, watermarks, text, etc. 
- Outputs text, HTML, Markdown, JSON, and Chunks.
- This is a great option for documents which contain tables, and documents where the structure of the information on the page is important for human-level understanding (for example: invoices, receipts, and bills-of-lading).
- Supports PDF, Word documents, and JPEG images.

## Authentication 

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens.
