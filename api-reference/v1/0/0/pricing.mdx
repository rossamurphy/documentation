## We charge per page

We count the number of pages in each document you post to our API, and we bill you based on that number. We will charge you a set amount of credits per page we process. 

We calculate the number of credits you need, to successfully fulfil your request, before we start processing. If you don't have enough credits, we'll let you know, and, we'll tell you how many more credits you need to proceed.

It's really easy to check how many credits you have, and to add more, [here](https://readfile.io/dashboard).

## Better models cost more 

You can choose the model you want to process your file, by using [query parameters](https://apidog.com/articles/http-request-parameters-guide/).


## It's cheaper to buy in bulk 

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.
