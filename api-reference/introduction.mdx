description: 'How to use the ReadFile API service'
---

## Welcome

ReadFile functions entirely via requests. There's absolutely zero dependencies. You can use it in the browser, on the server, or in any programming language you like.

If you have an enterprise plan, we deploy a Docker image in your environment, and expose it internally in your VPC, so again, it's as simple as making a request to an endpoint. 

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated with API keys. You can get one [here](https://readfile.io/dashboard). New API keys come with 300 free credits for you to try out our service. If you love our product, you can easily top up your credits [here](https://readfile.io/pricing).

To make an authenticated API request, simply pass the API key in the headers, for example:

```zsh
curl -X POST https://api.readfile.io/v1.0.0/file/read \
-H "X-API-KEY: <YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>" \
-F "file=@<YOUR_FILE_PATH_HERE>"
```
