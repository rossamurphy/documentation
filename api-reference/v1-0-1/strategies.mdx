## Default
- Choose this strategy by adding the query parameter "default", i.e. `?strategy=default` at the end of the URL (or, by simply leaving it blank).
- The _fastest and cheapest_ strategy.
- Extracts _text_ from files, and makes no attempt to extract anything more.
- This means it's great for long contracts full of words, for example, but not a great option for documents which are full of tables (and where you need the information contained in the tables).
- Outputs text (i.e. you should expect to receive a string back).
- Supports PDF and Word documents.

**Cost: 1 credit per page.**

### Vision

- Choose this strategy by adding the query parameter "vision", i.e. `?strategy=vision` at the end of the URL.
- Can read everything from files, i.e. tables, images, watermarks, text, etc.
- Outputs text (i.e. you should expect to receive a string back).
- This is a great option for documents which contain tables, and documents where the structure of the information on the page is important for human-level understanding (for example: invoices, receipts, and bills-of-lading).
- Supports PDF, Word documents, and JPEG images.

**Cost: 2 credits per page.**

### SOTA

- Choose this strategy by adding the query parameter "sota", i.e. `?strategy=sota` at the end of the URL.
- Can read everything from files, i.e. tables, images, watermarks, text, etc.
- Outputs text, HTML, Markdown, JSON, and Chunks. All formats are computed at runtime, and you can choose which one you access later.
- This is a great option for documents which contain tables, and documents where the structure of the information on the page is important for human-level understanding (for example: invoices, receipts, and bills-of-lading).
- Supports PDF, Word documents, and JPEG images.

**Cost: 4 credits per page.**
