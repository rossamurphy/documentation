## You subscribe, to buy a fixed number of credits per month 

- The more credits you sign up to buy each month, the cheaper the price per credit.
- Your credits reload every month. They don't roll from one period to the next.
- If you run out of credits, you can buy more, at the same price-per-credit as your subscription (just email us at support@readfile.io). You can also upgrade your subscription very easily, via Stripe.

## We charge you a number of credits per page, depending on the processing strategy you select 

Currently, the pricing is as follows:

#### Default
1 credit per page.

#### Vision
2 credits per page.

#### SOTA
4 credits per page.
