## v1.0.0

- We launched! 
- Users can post PDF, Docx, and .png images to api.readfile.io/file/read, and (nearly) instantly get text back.

## v1.0.1

- Added .jpg and .jpeg support for OCR.
- Added the ability to choose a "strategy" via a query parameter on the file/read endpoint. For example, for a PDF file, users can choose between "default", "ocr", and "ai": "default" is super fast and cheap, and will only return text, "ocr" will use a small machine learning model to do optical character recognition over every page of the PDF as an image, "ai" will do the same, but with a larger, state-of-the-art transformer model.

## v1.0.2

- Coming soon.
